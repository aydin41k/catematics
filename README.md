# Catematics 🐾🔢

Kids need to practice maths. They don't like homeworks. Instead, they like their screens. Incoming Catematics!

## How to Play 🎮

- Go to our glorious website: http://catematics.com
- Each round, you'll be presented with an addition problem (complexity level is in the settings).
- To answer, simply drag the appropriate number of big cats (worth 10), medium cats (worth 5) and small kittens (worth 1) into the bucket.
- Hit the "Submit" button to check your answer. If you get it right, you earn a win! If not, try again!
- ...or skip if you are not sure.
- Your total wins are tracked and saved, so you can see how much you've improved over time.

## Features 🌟

- Cats - can't go wrong with them
- Simple drag-and-drop gameplay
- Score tracking - if a kids wants something, they need to work for it
- Open source - it is you who decides where this one goes!

## Installation 🛠️

So simple that instructions are excessive. Until we move to React, that is.
